## Overview

The 'updatinate' tool is a collection of update scripts to keep upstreams up-to-date.

- php:rpm:update: Check for new php releases in [php.net/distributions](http://php.net/distributions) and create a pull requests in the [pantheon-systems/rpmbuild-php](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/rpmbuild-php) project as needed.
- php:cookbook:update: After a php rpmbuild completes, this command will create a pull request in the [php cookbook](https://github.com/pantheon-cookbooks/php) to deploy the new RPMs.

## Authentication

There are two ways to provide authentication credentials when using the updatinate commands.

- Environment variable: Define `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the apporpriate personal access token.
- On-disk cache: See [updatinate.yml](updatinate.yml) for the location to store the personal access token. Use the `--as` option to select between different cache locations.

The authentication credentials you will need can be found in the [pantheon-upstream onelogin note](https://pantheon.onelogin.com/notes/58434). 

## Automation

The [pantheon-systems/updatinator](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/updatinator) project runs the automation processes in CircleCI 2.0 scripts.

## Local Development

Clone the GitHub repository and run `composer install` to get started.

### Running the tests

The test suite may be run locally by way of some simple composer scripts:

| Test             | Command
| ---------------- | ---
| Run all tests    | `composer test`
| PHPUnit tests    | `composer unit`
| PHP linter       | `composer lint`
| Code style       | `composer cs`     
| Fix style errors | `composer cbf`

### Releasing

To release a new version of the updatinate tool, run:

- `composer release`

This will release a stable version of whatever is indicated in the VERSION file. e.g. if VERSION contains `1.0.3-dev`, then version `1.0.3` will be tagged and released, and the VERSION file will be updated to `1.0.4-dev`. To release version `1.1.0` instead, manually edit the VERSION file to `1.1.0-dev` and then run `composer release`.

The updatinate.phar file will be uploaded to GitHub on every release. Rebuild [pantheon-systems/docker-updatinator](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/docker-updatinator) to deploy a new version of the tool to the automation processes.
